In this project I've implemented Insertion sort in Circular linked list

I've tried to automize it, so that user can input whatever he/she wants to fully test my programm
When you run the programm it will ask you the number of your inputs, and then, of course, your inputs

After that the programm will automatically convert it into linked list, from which he then gets the values and sorts from smallest to biggest  and returns to the user.

Also during quiz my laptops battery died, so I was forced to go into AUA lab and write program there using Online Compler https://www.onlinegdb.com/ as there was no Pycharm installed in computer.
